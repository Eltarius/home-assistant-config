# My Home Assistant config

Welcome to my Home Assistant configuration!

Don't be scared by the non standard strusture of the Home Assistant configuration folder.
I'm inspired by [the strucutre propsed by Franck Nijhof](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config).

This system is very modular and very differently structured compared to other configurations you'll find online.
Basically, each file in the repository does 1 (one, uno, eins)
thing only! Search file with the name of the component, click through it, you'll get it pretty fast. The configuration.yaml is only used to bootstrap the system
and contains some minimal, but vital, settings.

You can watch [a video by Franck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lndeybw21PY) explaining why is doing that way.
