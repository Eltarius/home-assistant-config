# My Home Assistant config

Welcome to my Home Assistant configuration!

Don't be scared by the non standard strusture of the Home Assistant configuration folder.
I'm inspired by [the strucutre propsed by Franck Nijhof](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config).

This system is very modular and very differently structured compared to other configurations you'll find online.
Basically, each file in the repository does 1 (one, uno, eins)
thing only! Click through it, you'll get it pretty fast. he configuration.yaml is only used to bootstrap the system
and contains some minimal, but vital, settings.

You can watch [a video by Franck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lndeybw21PY) explaining why is doing that way.
